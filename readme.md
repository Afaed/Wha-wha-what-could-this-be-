## Process

When working on this project my first instinct was to google random number generator on the internet and "borrow" the ideas they had in their java scirpt. However, what I did not account for was the fact that I did not follow the search criteria. As a result, I had to start my work all over starting friday. :-D

Happy thoughts.

So when re-doing the project, I realized that doing "if" loops wasn't good enough and made vsstudiocode want to uninstall itself from my pc. So I asked the people at ask Slackbot (god bless thier souls I owe them coffee) how to become more effective at programming the random password generator, I learned that while and let statmenets were the best for the job. Then I had to look up arrays and learned the finer subtleties of arrays in programming which require a [] in the "for" loop rather than the parentheses.

## Issues

Aside from having to learn Javascript quickly and misunderstanding the project? Well, I kind of had to learn how to apply while statments, for loops, and arrays into a program which turned out to be very hard in two days. But I learned!

The big lesosn i've learned while doing this is that (a) looking things up is fine but you can't be cheap and (b) read everything and ask if you have questions on what to change. 

At the end of the day, figuring out how to use the password randomizer and let/while loops was acutally pretty fun and hopefully I can find other applications for it later. Once I completely understand it.
