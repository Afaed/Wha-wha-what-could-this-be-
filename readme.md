## Process
when doing the project, I realized that doing if loops wasn't good enough, so while asking on slack how to do this I learned that while and let statmenets were the best for the job.

## Issues

Aside from everything and trying to be cheeky and misunderstanding the project? Not much. A big lesosn i've learned while doing this is that (a) looking things up is fine but you can't be cheap. (b) read everything and ask if you have questions on what to change.

Figuring out how to use the password randomizer and let/while loops was acutally pretty fun. Learning how to tie it together was important.
